Working Directory → Staging Area → Commit → Remote Repo

You edit files → they are in your working directory
You run git add → files move to the staging area
You run git commit → staged files are permanently saved in Git histoy

# BASIC COMMANDS
1. git add → Stages your changed files so they’re ready to be committed.
2. git commit -m "comment" → Saves your staged changes with a message describing what you did.
3. git push → Uploads your committed changes to the remote repository (GitHub, etc.).

4. git status → Shows the current state of your files (modified, staged, untracked).
5. git log → Shows the commit history with commit IDs, messages, and authors.
git clone → is used to copy (download) an entire Git repository from any git server

# UNDO UNCOMMITED CHANGES
git restore <file> → Discards changes in that specific file and restores it to the last committed version
git restore . → Discards all uncommitted changes in your working directory.

# UNDO COMMITED CHANGES
git revert <commitID> → Creates a new commit that reverses the changes made in the specified commit (safe undo).
git revert -n <commitID> → Reverts the commit but does not auto-commit

git reset --hard → forcefully discards all local changes and returns your code to the last committed state.
